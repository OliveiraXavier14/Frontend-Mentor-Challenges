## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned
One of my major learning while working through this project was the use of method forEach. It was the first time that i use it and i learned how to work with it.

```css
@media (max-width: 375px) {
  body {
    display: flex;
  }

  #back-desktop {
    display: none;
  }
  #back-mobile {
    display: block;
  }

  #container {
    width: 90%;
    max-width: 350px;
    margin-top: -200px;
  }

  .icon {
    width: 24px;
  }

  .accordion-body {
    font-size: 14px;
  }
  .accordion-body.active {
    height: auto;
  }
}
```
```js
accordions.forEach((accordion) => {
  accordion.addEventListener('click', () => {
    const body = accordion.nextElementSibling;
    body.classList.toggle('active');
    
    const icon = accordion.querySelector('.icon')

    if (body.classList.contains('active')){
      icon.src = 'assets/images/icon-minus.svg'
    }else {
      icon.src = 'assets/images/icon-plus.svg'
    }
  });
});
```


### Continued development
Some aspects that iÂ´m not totally comfortable with and i want to improve in the future is the use of @media and how i can turn a website more responsive.



### Useful resources

- (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyFiT4ofMwk&t=113sm) - This helped me with @media. I really liked this method and will use it going forward.
